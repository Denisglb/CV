I developed a passion for web development in early 2016. I wanted to start my own company and attempted to create a website from scratch. I followed various Wordpress tutorials online and since that moment I caught the 'bug'. Fast forward to the present, I am now an energetic and ambitious Junior Developer, looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge. 

After completing my first year of engineering at Nottingham University I was offered work experience at Kittitian Hill in St.Kitts & Nevis which turned into a job and I decided to take a year out of education to work. I enjoyed the fast-paced environment and learning new skills on the job quickly. I was then offered an apprenticeship back in London where I would be able to study and work at the same time and I wouldn't have to worry too much about student loans holding me back in the future. 

In the last 5 months I learnt to code at Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp. Started working on an amazing side project, Recurrio with some fellow Makers graduates and hoping to bring it to the market soon! 

Tech Skills : Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Swift, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL

## Skills

#### Fast Learner

I think this goes for all Makers Graduates but my final project proved to be extremely difficult. We worked with hardware and completely new software languages (Swift, C) and frameworks (Xcode) to create an exciting product all in the space of 2 weeks! All this without any guidance. 


#### Entreprenurial

I got into Shell Ideas360 penultimate stage beating 1000's of other applicants for my commercialised plastic to oil machine business plan. The idea was to be able to transform plastic back to oil through pyrolysis. Creating a sustainable way of disposing of heavy plastics. I am always looking for ways to create business and add value, it got me in trouble when I was 13 years old and would sell sugary sweets to class friends. 

#### Hard-Working

My apprenticeship programme allowed me to get a university degree and work at the same time. I always managed to complete my work and managed my time efficiently. I would frequently be able to work in different departments and contribute in different sectors of the company. 

#### Adaptable

I have worked in the UK and St.Kitts in both small and large companies across different teams. I have also repsented my comapny at various conferences in Toronto, Moscow, Ukraine and Spain. I therefore feel confident in communicating with colleagues from different cultures in different languages and people of varying levels within the company.

#### Communication

Worked under pressure and managed to keep clients calm. This was particularly difficult during Brexit for my previous company where clients would panic. There would be frequent discussion about investing in the UK and at the beginning I found it difficult as a babyfaced 21 year old to convince clients to trust me with investing Â£2 million into the UK economy. Over time this became easier and clients would feel more at ease. I recently was invited to give a talk about STEM subjects to over 100 students in Russia over Skype which is an extremely difficult way to make an interpersonal connection but gave me a chance to improve my public speaking.
